# SlipUp — Brand & Trademark Priority (Internal Use Only)

**Purpose:** Even if we are not paying for a trademark application now, we need to **prove that we were the first to use the name SlipUp**. This document is for internal use only. Do not publish this on the live site.

---

## Why this matters

If someone else tries to register a similar trademark before we do, we can rely on **evidence of first use** of the name and brand. Dated proof (screenshots, files, emails) helps establish that we used “SlipUp” in commerce or in public first. **Save everything in a way that preserves dates** — dated PDFs, ZIPs, and emails to ourselves count as legal proof.

## Recommended evidence to collect and keep

### 1. Screenshots (dated)

- **Website:** Full-page or key-page screenshots of www.slipup.io (home, app, landing).
- **Logo:** Any logo or wordmark that shows “SlipUp.”
- **Name in use:** Any place the name “SlipUp” appears (app title, headers, meta tags, marketing copy).

**How to date:** Save screenshots with filenames that include the date (e.g. `slipup-website-2026-02-06.png`). When possible, include a visible date on the page (e.g. “Last updated”) or take a screenshot that shows the browser/OS date.

### 2. Product development start date

- Record the **date we started** developing or using the product under the name SlipUp (e.g. first commit, first design, first public or internal use).
- Keep this in a short internal note (e.g. “SlipUp development started: [date]”) and store it in a dated file or email.

### 3. Dated design and marketing files

- Early design mockups, UI sketches, or branding drafts that use “SlipUp.”
- Marketing or landing copy (e.g. taglines, descriptions) that mention SlipUp.
- Any logos, icons, or brand guidelines (even simple ones).

**Tip:** Keep original files with “Date created” / “Date modified” intact. When exporting, use “Save as PDF” or add the date to the filename so the date is clear.

### 4. Emails or internal work notes

- Emails that mention SlipUp, the product, or the brand (to/from team, contractors, testers).
- Internal notes, specs, or meeting notes that reference SlipUp and the product.

**Why emails help:** Sending a summary or key files **to yourself by email** creates a dated record (the email timestamp) that can serve as legal proof of when we had the name and materials.

## How to store and back up

1. **Gather** all of the above (screenshots, start date note, design/marketing files, and any relevant emails or notes).
2. **Save as dated PDF or ZIP:**
   - Put everything in a folder.
   - Name it clearly, e.g. `SlipUp-Brand-Evidence-YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Create a ZIP (or PDF bundle) with that date in the name.
3. **Email a copy to yourself:** Send the ZIP or key PDFs to your own email. The **sent date** of the email is additional proof of when we had the materials.
4. **Keep a backup** in a safe place (cloud drive, internal server) and update it when you add new evidence (e.g. new screenshots after a site redesign).

*This is crucial if someone tries to register a similar trademark before we do. Update this document and the evidence pack when the product or brand changes.*
